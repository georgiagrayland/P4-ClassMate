## Introduction

Welcome to ClassMate

ClassMate is my my Portfolio Project 4 submission for Code Institute’s Diploma in Full Stack Software Development Course.

The purpose of this project was to build a full-stack site based on user needs and a custom dataset.

ClassMate is a fictional forum website based around fictional schools, allowing users to browse schools in different regions and participate in discussion and comments on each school. 

ClassMate has been built built using the **Django full-stack framework** and uses a Relational Database. Technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 

This project is entirely for educational purposes only, all information included is fictional and no revenue is generated.

## UXD - User Experience Design
 The user was kept in mind through the entire development process of this project, so that experience using the site would be maximised and user needs would be satisfied. 
 Thus, the planning of the project was constructed of 5 planes, namely, the 5 elements of User Experience Design: 
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane, 
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

These planes move from most-least abstract, with each previous one creating an outline for the next. Each plane has required meeting different goals and completing different tasks throughout project development.

## The Strategy Plane
### Developer Goals
- As a site owner, I want the site to be easy to navigate 
- As a site owner, I want the site to look aesthetically pleasing, accessible, and relevant to the theme of the information.
- As a site owner, I want to be able to provide some value to users. 
- As an admin user, I want to be able to Add, Edit, and Delete Schools from the forum.
- As an admin user, I want to be able to approve or reject comments that have been made by logged in users. 

### User Stories
#### Regular Site User Stories
- As a site user, I want to know the purpose of the site upon reaching the first landing page (homepage) so that I do not have to waste time working out what it is for. 
- As a site user, I want to be able to seamlessly navigate through the site, so that I can view any desired page within the site.
- As a site user, I want to be able to sign up to the site, so that I can enjoy the additional benefits of having an account. 
- As a site user, I want to be able to view relevant information easily on all pages, and understand what is displayed on the site, with the use of icons, images, text, and headings. 
- As a site user, I want to be able to see the posts from other users on relevant pages, so that I can make informed decisions and understand other people’s opinions and experiences. 
- As a user, I want to be prompted to create an account and know why I should, so that I can enjoy the additional benefits of having one on this sit. 
- As a user I want to be able to view the footer on any page, and access Social media links directly from here by clicking on the icons, with the Social Media page opening in a new tab. 

#### Active User (Logged In) Stories 
- As a user with an account, I want to be able to log in easily, viewing a clear clear link to log in on any part of the site (on the Navigation Bar). 
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to add comments on any School Detail page, with my username present so that I know who I am posting as. 
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to see that my comments have been posted admins and are awaiting approval to be viewed on the site. 
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to post multiple comments on an individual School Detail page, so that I can ask questions of other users and gather information I may desire about specific schools. 
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to know where I can go to see all of my comments I have made on the site, and be able to access this page easily. 
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to see all of my comments on any School on a single page, and from here, have the choice and ability to seamlessly Edit or Delete them.

## The Scope Plane
The full range of features I had initially wanted to include in this project were not achievable within the available timeframe for the deadline. Therefore, this project was created in sections, whereby features were incrementally designed and implemented to meet the project requirements and user goals:
Features Included were implemented using Agile Principles, in this order: 

**Block 1**
- 

**Block 2**
- 

**Block 3**

## Features 
*Across the project*:
- All pages of the project are responsive to a wide range of screen sizes.
- Semantic HTML is used throughout.
- Custom CSS is blended with Bootstrap 5 to give the site a user-friendly, aesthetic, and intuitive experience. 

**Features Present on all pages**:

### Navigation Bar
- Navigation Bar is present on all pages of the site. 
    - It is fully responsive to all possible screen sizes, with a collapsible menu that forms on narrower screen widths.
- Using the Navigation bar, users can move through the site seamlessly, with clear messaging used on it to where the links will take them.  
- The ClassMate logo is present on the left, which changes to white when hovered, and when clicked, takes the user back to the homepage, no matter where they are currently in the site. 
- For all users, there is a link to the page to 'Browse all Schools'.
    - This link changes color and adds an underline when hovered, for accessibility and ease of use for the user. 

- If a user is not logged in, the navbar will display a button link that says 'SIGNUP/LOGIN'. 
    - This link changes to a contrasting colour and underlines when hovered. 
    - When clicked, it takes the user to the 'Sign in' page. Here, they may either Sign in if they have an existing accoutn or there is also a link and message on this page that takes them to the 'singup' page.
